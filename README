ActsAsArchival
==============
Plugin for atomically archiving model records in activerecord models.

We had the problem that acts_as_paranoid and similar plugins/gems always work on a record by record basis and made it very difficult to restore records atomically (or archive them, for that matter).

Install
=======
script/plugin install http://github.com/expectedbehavior/acts_as_archival.git/


Example
=======

class Hole < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_archival
  has_many :moles, :dependent => :destroy
end

class Mole < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_archival
end


Caveats
=======
* This will only work on associations that are dependent destroy.  It should be trival to change that or make it optional.
* It will only work for Rails 2.2 and up, because we are using named_scope.  You can check out permanent records for a way to conditionally add the functionality to older Rails installations.

Thanks

ActsAsParanoid and PermanentRecords were both inspirations for this
